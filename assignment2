1. What do you mean by Structures?

Structure in C is a user-defined data type that allows you to combine data items of different types into a single unit.

It is used to represent a record — for example, a student with name, roll number, and marks.

Example:
#include <stdio.h>

struct Student {
    int roll_no;
    char name[50];
    float marks;
};

int main() {
    struct Student s1 = {1, "Alice", 89.5};
    printf("Roll No: %d\n", s1.roll_no);
    printf("Name: %s\n", s1.name);
    printf("Marks: %.2f\n", s1.marks);
    return 0;
}


Here,

struct Student is the structure definition.

s1 is a variable of type struct Student.

2. What do you mean by Array & Pointers Array?
Array:

An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.

Example:

int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};


Here, arr is an array of 5 integers.

Pointer Array:

An array of pointers is an array where each element is a pointer (usually pointing to data like variables or strings).

Example:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char *names[] = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("%s\n", names[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}


Here, names is an array of 3 pointers to char, each pointing to a string.

3. Compare two structure variables using comparison operators

In C, you cannot directly use == or != to compare structure variables.

You must compare each member individually or use functions like memcmp().

Example:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

struct Student {
    int roll_no;
    char name[50];
    float marks;
};

int main() {
    struct Student s1 = {1, "Alice", 89.5};
    struct Student s2 = {2, "Bob", 78.0};

    if (s1.roll_no == s2.roll_no && strcmp(s1.name, s2.name) == 0 && s1.marks == s2.marks) {
        printf("Structures are equal.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Structures are not equal.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}

4. Perform arithmetic operations on structures

You cannot directly perform arithmetic (like +, -, *, /) on entire structures,
but you can perform arithmetic on structure members.

Example:
#include <stdio.h>

struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

int main() {
    struct Point p1 = {10, 20};
    struct Point p2 = {5, 7};
    struct Point result;

    result.x = p1.x + p2.x;
    result.y = p1.y + p2.y;

    printf("Resultant Point: (%d, %d)\n", result.x, result.y);
    return 0;
}


Output:

Resultant Point: (15, 27)
